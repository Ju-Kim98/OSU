We will also learn how to tabulate counts of edges of different edge types (there are various edge types encoded in the second column of the tab-delimited file) and how to load the edge-list data into an `igraph.Graph` python object (representing an undirected graph) in the `igraph` software packge. We use an edge-list data file that has been obtained from the Pathway Commons 2 database; the file is in a tab-delimited ASCII text format called Simple Interaction Format (SIF).\n","The SIF (Simple Interaction File) format looks like this:\n","```\n","A1BG    controls-expression-of  A2M\n","A1BG    interacts-with  ABCC6\n","A1BG    interacts-with  ACE2\n","A1BG    interacts-with  ADAM10\n","A1BG    interacts-with  ADAM17\n","A1BG    interacts-with  ADAM9\n","```\n","where the first and third columns contain the names biochemical molecule types (which we sometimes call \"biochemical species\" if we are being extra-general; the ALLCAPS names are human gene symbols, but they really refer to the *proteins* encoded by the genes). The second column contains one of thirteen different interaction types (i.e., edge labels). The data file originally came from the Pathway Commons 2 database \"release 9\" (http://www.pathwaycommons.org/archives/PC2/v9/PathwayCommons9.All.hgnc.sif.gz), but in this notebook, we will read the data from an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) public storage \"bucket\" (URL to be provided below), initially using a HTTP request with uncompression on-the-fly (and then later in the notebook, by simply downloading the file into your Google Colab compute instance). In this notebook, you'll be using the Python modules `gzip`, `timeit`, `pandas`, `urllib.request`, `collections`  `operator`, `cairo`, `numpy`, and `igraph`.\n","\n","### What you will do with the data from the SIF file\n","\n","- Print the first six lines of the uncompressed data file\n","- Use a python `timeit` timer to time how long your program takes\n","- Count how many rows there are in the data file\n","- Estimate the number of proteins in the database; we'll define them operationally as strings in column 1 or column 3, for which the content of column 2 is one of these interactions: `interacts-with`, `in-complex-with`, or `neighbor-of`\n","- Count the total number of unique pairs of interacting molecules (ignoring interaction type)\n","- Count the number rows for each type of interaction in the database\n","- Pythonistas: do it using `pandas`, and then do it without using `pandas`\n","\n","### Step-by-step instructions for Python3:\n","\n","- Open a file object representing a stream of the remote, compressed data file, using the function `urllib.request.urlopen`\n","- Open a file object representing a stream of the uncompressed data file, using a `gzip.GzipFile` object\n","- Start the `timeit` timer\n","- Read one line at a time, until the end of the file\n","- Split line on \"\\t\" and pull out the tuple of species1, interaction_type, species2 from the line of text\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qJSvqWdiACqJ"},"source":["In order to be able to plot in igraph, we will first need the PyPI package `cairo` to be installed, which requires first installing some APT packages (`libcairo2-dev`, `libjpeg2-dev`, and `libgif-dev`).
